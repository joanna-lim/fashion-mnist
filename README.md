# CNN and Vision Transformer on the Fashion MNIST Dataset

This repository contains code for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The purpose is to compare the performance of these two architectures and to evaluate the impact of data augmentation using mixup.
